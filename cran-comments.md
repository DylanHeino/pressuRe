## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Reduced the number of examples for the mask_analysis function.
* Corrected version number (0.21 > 0.2.1)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note


* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is  8.2Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    extdata   7.9Mb
    
This note refers to the pressure data for this package. These files tend to be 
large and are important to demonstrate the utility of the package and its 
options for loading and processing pressure data collected using different 
hardware. These are unlikely to change in future versions of the package.
